# STM PROJECT
Project for the course Microprocessor Systems

The purpose of the project is to perform automatic temperature adjustment using a microprocessor.

The project uses:
- Evaluation board  Nucleo-F746ZG
- Resistor 24 Ohm used as a heater
- Bipolar Transistor BC547B
- Transistor MOSFET IRL540N
- Power supply (Voltage 10V)
- Resistors and potentiometer
- LCD display


The control was made using the PID controller in C language.
The GUI used to present the results was created using the Python language with the Tkinter library.
